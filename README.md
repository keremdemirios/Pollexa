- iOS Version and Framework: The app is built for iOS 17.0 and above using UIKit framework.
  
- Architecture: MVVM architecture pattern is employed. This pattern divides the codebase into view, view model, and model layers, facilitating separation of concerns and easing unit testing.
    -  The main idea behind this approach is to divide the codebase into three main components: View, ViewModel, and Model. While the View represents the user interface, the ViewModel connects the view with the model and performs business logic and data processing operations. The Model encompasses the data and business logic of the application. This way, each component is independent, enabling easier unit testing and making the application code more modular.

- UI Layout: The UI layout and interconnections between components are established using UIStoryboard. This facilitates the visual arrangement and interactions of UI elements.
